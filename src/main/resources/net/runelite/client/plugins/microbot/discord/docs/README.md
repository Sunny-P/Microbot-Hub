# Discord Plugin

The **Discord Plugin** for the Microbot RuneLite client integrates Discord functionality directly into Old School RuneScape (OSRS). It allows users to receive notifications, interact with Discord, and manage settings from within the RuneLite client.

## Features

- **Discord Notifications:** Receive in-game notifications for important events via Discord.
- **Customizable Settings:** Configure which events trigger Discord notifications using the plugin settings.
- **In-Game Panel:** Manage Discord integration and view status directly from a sidebar panel.

## How It Works

1. **Configure:** Set up your Discord preferences in the plugin configuration (such as webhook URLs or notification types).
2. **Start:** Enable the plugin from the sidebar.
3. **Automate:** The plugin will send notifications to your configured Discord channel based on your settings.
4. **Manage:** Use the in-game panel to view status and manage integration.
