2. **Start:** Enable the plugin and start the script from the sidebar panel.
3. **Automation:** The script will:
    - Locate and attack Virewatch Sentinels
    - Activate the selected prayer style
    - Loot valuable drops based on your configuration
    - Alch items if enabled and requirements are met
    - Display status and loot information in the overlay panel
4. **Stop:** You can stop the script at any time from the panel.

## Limitations
