# House Thieving Plugin

The **House Thieving Plugin** automates the process of thieving from houses in Old School RuneScape, making it easier to train Thieving and collect loot from various in-game houses.

---

## Features

- Automatically navigates to and thieves from supported houses
- Handles movement, interaction, and loot collection
- Overlay displays current status, actions, and progress
- Integrates with the Microbot RuneLite client

---

## Requirements

- Microbot RuneLite client
- Sufficient Thieving level for target houses
- Plugin enabled in the Microbot plugin list

---

## How It Works

1. Configure the plugin with your desired house or thieving method.
2. Start the plugin from the Microbot sidebar.
3. The script moves your character to the appropriate house, performs thieving actions, and collects loot.
4. An overlay displays the current status, including which house is being targeted and thieving progress.

---

## Configuration

- Select which house to thieve from (see `HouseThievingConfig.java` and `ThievingHouse.java`)
- Enable/disable overlay
- Adjust thieving intervals or behavior if supported

---

## Limitations

- Only supports houses and methods defined in the plugin (`ThievingHouse.java`)
- Does not handle banking or inventory management beyond thieving actions
- Only automates the thieving process
