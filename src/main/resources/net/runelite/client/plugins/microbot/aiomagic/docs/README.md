## How It Works

1. **Configuration:**  
   The user selects the desired Magic activity and configures spell options in the plugin panel.

2. **Startup:**  
   The plugin checks for required runes, items, and inventory space. If needed, it will bank for supplies.

3. **Automation Loop:**  
   The script performs the selected Magic activity, casting spells, managing inventory, and handling banking as needed.

4. **Overlay:**  
   Displays real-time information such as:
    - Current activity and spell
    - Experience gained
    - Number of casts performed
    - Runtime and efficiency stats

5. **Failsafes:**  
   Stops or pauses if requirements are not met, or if unexpected events occur.

- Adjust advanced options (delays, anti-patterns, etc.)
