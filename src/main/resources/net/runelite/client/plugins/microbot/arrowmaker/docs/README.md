# Arrow Maker Plugin

The **Arrow Maker Plugin** automates the process of making arrows, bolts, darts, and tipping dragon items in Old School RuneScape, making fletching training and item production more efficient.

---

## Features

- Automatically crafts arrows, bolts, and darts from raw materials
- Supports dragon item tipping and standard arrow/broad bolt tipping
- Customizable item selection (arrows, bolts, darts, dragon tips)
- Overlay displays current crafting status and progress
- Integrates with the Microbot RuneLite client

---

## Requirements

- Microbot RuneLite client
- Plugin enabled in the Microbot plugin list

---

## How It Works

1. Configure the plugin with the type of item you wish to make (arrows, bolts, darts, or dragon tips).
2. Start the plugin from the Microbot sidebar.
3. The script withdraws required materials from the bank, combines them, and repeats the process.
4. An overlay displays the current crafting status and progress.

---

## Configuration

- Select which item to make (see `ArrowConfig.java` and the `enums` folder for options)
- Enable/disable overlay
- Adjust crafting intervals or behavior if supported

---

## Limitations

- Only supports items defined in the `enums` folder (Arrows, Bolts, Darts, Tipping, DragonTipping)
- Does not handle buying materials or selling finished products
- Only automates the crafting process
